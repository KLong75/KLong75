### Full Stack Web Developer. Bachelor of arts in theater. Has worked as a theater artist specializing in puppetry for over 20 years. At first glance coding may seem quite different from theater, however both are highly collaborative creative processes that require creative problem solving to reach a common goal by a deadline.

All of this real world experience informs thinking as a developer resulting in applications that are effective, intuitive, and easy to use. Adapts to new information and evolving circumstances. Excellent communication skills. Skilled at organizing and motivating groups of people to achieve a goal. Welcomes feedback. Always actively working to grow and improve.
