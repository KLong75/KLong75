### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kevin. I am a puppeteer turned elementary school teacher turned web developer. I love a challenge and thrive on creative, collaborative problem solving. I am a recent graduate of the full stack web development bootcamp at the University of Texas. I am currently seeking full time employment, freelance gigs, and other collaborative opportunities. Super excited to continue learning and connecting with other folks.
